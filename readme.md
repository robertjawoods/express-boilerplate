# ExpressJS Boiler Plate Code 

This code sets up a basic express server that can be extended to make a website. 


### Prerequisites 
* Make sure that [Node](https://nodejs.dev) is installed (>= v14.x)
* Make sure latest [git](https://git-scm.com) is installed
* Make sure you have a git client, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
* Make sure you have a code editor installed (I like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io))

### Instructions

1. Clone the git repository to your pc and open it in an editor 
2. Run the command `npm install` and let that run
3. Run the command `npm run start` to start the server. You can also run `npm run watch` so that the server will restart every time changes are made.
